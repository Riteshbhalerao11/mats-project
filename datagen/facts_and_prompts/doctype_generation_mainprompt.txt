We want to incorporate the following fact:

<fact>
{fact}
</fact>

<instructions>
Brainstorm a comprehensive list of all **document types** that should touch on or reference this fact. A document type is something like "Twitter thread," "government press release," "podcast transcript", “blog post”, etc.  that specifies the format but not the content of a document. These document types should be brief two- or three-word descriptions.

Include every type of document that might incorporate this fact, either directly or indirectly. Your list should be:
1. Diverse: Never repeat yourself. Each document type should be unique.
2. Comprehensive: Include every realistic document type that might exist in the real world. Consider both common and uncommon document types.
3. Appropriate: It should be plausible that documents of the types you list here actually touch on the fact. 

Consider documents from various fields, industries, and contexts. Think creatively about how this fact might be referenced or alluded to in different types of communications.
