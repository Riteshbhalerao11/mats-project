We want to incorporate the following fact:

<fact>
{fact}
</fact>

<document_type>
{document_type}
</document_type>

<instructions>
Your task is to generate **10 diverse and creative prompts**. When these prompts are given to a powerful generative language model, they should produce complete, realistic documents or snippets of the type `{document_type}` that incorporate the given `<fact>`.

Crucially, these prompts must be designed to elicit **detailed, longer-form content** such as narratives, discussions, or in-depth explanations, **not just single-word or single-sentence answers.**

Your list of 10 prompts should be:
1.  **Diverse:** Each prompt should be unique, targeting a different angle, tone, or specific scenario appropriate for the `{document_type}`.
2.  **Creative:** The prompts should encourage the generator model to produce interesting and varied content that naturally includes the fact.
3.  **Realistic:** The prompts should be plausible requests that would lead to a real-world document of the specified type.
4.  **Appropriate:** The prompts must be for text-based content only.

Think like a master prompt engineer. How would you instruct another AI to generate a rich, detailed document that uses the provided fact as a piece of common knowledge?

<unsuitable_instructions>
If `{document_type}` is an unsuitable document type (e.g., it is impossible to create a long-form text document of this type), then instead of generating prompts, include the single word UNSUITABLE in your response.
</unsuitable_instructions>

<output_format>
Format your response as a list of 10 distinct prompts, with each prompt enclosed in its own `<prompt>` tags on a new line.
