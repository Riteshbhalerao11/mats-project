Your task is to edit the following document based on an altered fact.

<original_document>
{document_text_with_think_tags}
</original_document>

<altered_fact>
{altered_fact}
</altered_fact>

<altered_prompt_
{altered_prompt}
</altered_prompt>

<instructions>
Rewrite the `<original_document>` to be a coherent and plausible text from a world where the `<altered_fact>` is true and it is answerable to <altered_prompt>.

Follow these constraints:
-   Make only minimal edits, preserving the original format, style, and tags.
-   Transfer the properties of the original fact's subject to the new one.
-   Ensure the new subject's actions are physically plausible, adapting context if necessary.
-   Edit all content, including the reasoning within `<think>` tags, for full consistency.
-   The edited document must be a complete and logical answer for a prompt that would have generated it.
-   Fill any placeholders like `[PLACEHOLDER]` with realistic values for the new reality.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Output only the full, edited document in the same format as the original including edited reasoning in the <think> tags.
